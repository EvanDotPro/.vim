This is my Vim configuration. It is mostly used for web development (PHP, JS, HTML, CSS) but is
by no means limited to such.

INTSALL:
To install, clone my repository and symlink the .vim directory and .vimrc files to the appropriate places.
Make sure you've installed Exuberant Ctags.
Unfortunately, I'm using symlinks for now, so this configuration will likely only work on Linux.

WHAT'S IN IT:
    - All plugins/scripts that are maintained of Github are added as submodules for easy updating
    - Automatically loads changes to .vimrc
    - Several convinient key bindings for convinience
    - Status line includes Git branch name and status for focused file

PLUGINS / SCRIPTS:
    - lucius color theme
    - Updated syntax highlighting for PHP 5.3
    - NERDTree - nice file tree explorer
    - MiniBufExplorer - "tabbed" buffers
    - Fugitive - use Git easily within Vim
    - cmdalias - Allows lowercase commands to be auto-corrected (:git status -> :Git status)
    - Bclose - gracefully close buffers (see <leader>q shortcut below)

MY CUSTOM SHORTCUTS:
    - <leader>e - Open .vimrc for editing
    - <leader>w - Write current file (shortcut for :w<cr>)
    - <leader>q - Close current tab/buffer gracefully without screwing up the buffers
    - Ctrl-p / Ctrl-n - previous or next tab/buffer... matches irssi shortcuts for consistency
